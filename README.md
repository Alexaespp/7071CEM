This files countain the code for my Vertical Search Engine Application, similar to Google Scholar, exclusively indexing
publications authored by members of Coventry University (found in: https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/organisations/centre-for-global-learning/publications/). 
It is built in Python using BeautifulSoup in order to collect and parse relevant publication data and Flask to create the web interface.

The text classification system uses TF-IDF vectorization, sklearn library,
and tkinter interface, to categorize text into three distinct categories (Sports, Business and Science).
It is built in Python, using the nltk and sklearn library. The user interface is built using tkinter.
